# EnergyForecast
This is `Time Series Analysis` project with a visualization dashboard using R Shiny. The focus is to predict when will the Renewable Energy generation in the United States grow up to a certain percentage of the total energy production. However the dashboard can be used to draw multiple other conclusions and insights. <br>
The data I used for this project is directly gathered as a csv file from US Energy Information Administration. <br>
There are some basic probabilistic assumptions necessary to fit any time series model. <br>
* The future will probabilistically remain same as the past or the present. <br> 
I have tried to explore some basic and some major time series models. These models range from `Simple Trend` and `Seasonality` up to `Holt-winter` and `ARIMA`. <br>
With the kind of global focus on renewable energy sources, the growth of renewable energy production is exponentially on the rise. <br>
